          I am marketing automation specialist with over 5 years of experience, specializing in building, executing, and
          maintaining digital marketing strategies and campaigns. I am enthusiastic about digital marketing automation,
          and I always desire to improve automation processes.

          This website came to live due to the lack of standards and the inconsistent support across the various email
          clients and webmail services. Developing HTML emails and newsletters which look good and perform across these
          platforms and device types can be a challenging task. I want this website to be knowledgebase of code snippets
          that should be ready to copy and paste.
